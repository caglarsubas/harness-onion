# Linux runner candidate / external operator handoff

Phase: Alpha 2 foundation. Packet: MET-LINUX-002. This kit is source work only;
it does not install root authority or close CONF-LINUX-001. macOS remains the
development host. Linux runtime, OCP/Kubernetes, air gap and tenant acceptance
remain independent gates. No root files, GitHub workflows, product repository,
warm source or existing macOS operator installation may be changed by this PR.

## Contents and entry points

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| ci/linux-runner/common.py | Closed manifest/policy inputs, byte digests, no-follow root custody, exhaustive inventories and packet argv |
| ci/linux-runner/ed25519.py | Verification-only RFC 8032 implementation; independent published vectors, no key generation/signing |
| ci/linux-runner/launcher.py | Fixed installed identity, signed custody, Linux profile, descriptor handoff, fresh negatives, exact wrapper and deadline |
| ci/linux-runner/preflight.py | Kernel, namespace, network/socket, source/credential/trust metadata and descendant negative probes |
| ci/linux-runner/build.py | Byte-identical standard-library zipapp and source/artifact inventory |
| ci/linux-runner/prepare.py | Unsigned policy/profile rendering; no root writes |
| tests/linux_runner/ | Source-only adapters, malformed inputs, published signature vectors, deterministic build and full predecessor baseline |

The only packet acceptance command is the declared offline/frozen uv pytest
argv in task-packets/MET-LINUX-002.yaml, entered through the existing external
signed host launcher. It exercises packaging from tests; no product acceptance
command is run separately on the workstation. Nested predecessor checks stay
in that same isolated process tree and exclude only this new test directory
to prevent recursion. The builder is not an installer.

Reviewed standalone operator packaging argv, to be run only in the operator's
already authorized offline environment:

```text
python -IB ci/linux-runner/build.py --output <new-private-absolute-output-directory>
python -IB ci/linux-runner/prepare.py --request <reviewed-request.json> --output <another-new-private-absolute-directory>
```

Angle-bracket values are user-owned local paths, not working commands or invented
evidence. Both output directories must not exist. Builder writes a deterministic
`harness-offline-launch.candidate` (0555) and `inventory.json`; preparation emits
an unsigned policy and a candidate profile. The artifact excludes tests, keys,
policy, caches, platform binaries and generated native outputs. Build twice;
compare complete bytes and inventories, not only version strings.

## External installation and bootstrap sequence

This sequence describes independent operator responsibilities; no install,
sudo policy, password collection, key creation or provisioning script is supplied.
Use only existing authorized zero-incremental-cost native Linux capacity.

1. Independently review the exact candidate source/crypto/profile and package
   digests. A source-test PASS is not security review or Linux qualification.
2. Prestage Linux-native root-owned Python/tool/cache closures and the clean
   owned-product checkout. Supply complete [BUILD_INPUTS.md](BUILD_INPUTS.md).
   Pin Firejail binary, helper libraries and configuration in the immutable host
   image. Review actual feature support; this kit has no automatic upgrade path.
3. Keep the runner non-root, ephemeral and free of cloud/provider keys,
   kubeconfig, external credential homes, agent/control sockets and billable
   brokers. GitHub runner registration credentials stay in the separately
   hidden runnerHome, never the workspace or tool/cache inventories. All
   snapshots belong under the named root-owned warm container; reject aliases,
   extra roots or alternate bind mounts in the host image review.
4. Use existing independent operator authority to sign the exact data-only
   policy. Preserve previous installed bytes, modes, signatures and activation
   history as a rollback transaction before any installation.
5. Externally install reviewed candidate bytes as
   `/opt/planeon/bin/harness-offline-launch`, UID/GID 0, mode 0555; policy,
   signature and exact profile under `/etc/planeon/linux-runner/`; existing
   Ed25519 public key at `/etc/planeon/harness-runner-manifest.pub`; and the
   exact root-owned read-only packet at `/opt/planeon/packet/active.yaml`.
   Parent directories must be root-owned and not group/world writable. No
   symlinks, hardlinks, writable trust paths or copied macOS launcher are accepted.
6. Root-image custody at `/etc/planeon/linux-runner/custody.json` contains only
   `schemaVersion=planeon.linux-runner-custody/v1`, `publicKeySha256`,
   `launcherSha256`, `policySha256`. It is independently installed, not supplied
   by the checkout. The signed policy and exact installed launcher must match it.
7. Execute only the installed absolute launcher with `--operator-preflight`.
   This explicit bootstrap mode verifies that custody/signature/policy and fresh
   kernel boundary, but **cannot execute the repository wrapper** and does not
   require a previously published preflight PASS. This avoids a circular initial
   manifest/preflight dependency without fabricating an initial success record.
8. Independently retain and review that real host probe output. If any negative
   fails, do not sign a PASS manifest. Bind its exact digest in the unchanged
   trusted-runner manifest schema; sign that manifest using the existing key and
   install its manifest/signature/preflight at the existing fixed contract paths.
   Preflight binds launcher, policy, kernel, architecture and time; launcher
   rejects records older than one hour. A new policy requires new probe evidence.
9. Normal installed invocation (no arguments) now requires the signed manifest
   and bound preflight, rechecks all target/tool/cache inputs, creates a fresh
   Firejail boundary and reruns the negatives before the exact packet wrapper.
   Re-sign only reviewed exact packet/source inputs; do not accept an unknown
   candidate by moving a trust digest. Linux authority is separate from macOS.

Existing runner settings must equal the signed workspace, repository and commit;
HARNESS_WARM_SOURCE_ROOTS equals the exact newline-separated root inventory, or
NONE only for an externally proven empty container. Values never reach packet
commands. No setup script or plaintext administrator password is needed by the kit.

## Isolation and evidence semantics

Firejail creates independent network, PID and mount namespaces with no network,
no capabilities and no privilege escalation. Secondary syscall architectures,
new namespaces, socket creation/connect/send, ptrace/process_vm access,
pidfd_getfd and io_uring entry points are blocked. A failed or unsupported
backend never executes unisolated code. Strict socket creation denial means
tools requiring even loopback listeners are not compatible with this offline
profile; live service tests belong behind the separate conformance boundary.

The root-owned generated profile, not argv, contains source roots. The entire
warm container is hidden as well as its read-only/blacklisted roots: a blacklist
placeholder whose own stat succeeds cannot prove metadata denial. Probe paths
are opened only to test access and immediately closed; no source or credential
contents are read, enumerated or written even if a denial unexpectedly fails.
Tests require EPERM/EACCES for socket denial, never a timeout, route failure,
unsupported address family or DNS failure. IPv4, IPv6, UDP/DNS, loopback, Unix
pathname and abstract socket creation are tested without sending packets.

Only explicitly retained root-owned authority descriptors cross the Firejail
boundary: four for bootstrap probes, seven for normal execution (also manifest,
manifest signature and preflight). The trusted supervisor revalidates identity,
custody, pins and signatures, then closes all of them before repository code.
Ambient FDs are closed; stdin is replaced for packet commands. Supervisor
dumpability is disabled, namespace/proc argv leakage is probed, and a fresh
Python descendant must reproduce the negative controls. A pipe payload or
environment marker alone is never authority.

Exact prefetch and acceptance ordering and per-command packet digest checks
remain in the unchanged digest-pinned ARGV_ARRAY_V1 wrapper/transport. The root
supervisor also rechecks authority after the session and bounds the complete
process lifetime. No separate prefetch or command string is executed. The
unprivileged checkout is not permitted to install or mutate the host launcher.

- **SOURCE_PACKAGE_ONLY**: deterministic bytes, unit/adversarial tests, PR CI.
- **HOST_ISOLATION_ONLY**: fresh actual Linux preflight, independently installed
  and signature-bound. This is not a product image build, live runtime test or
  full native release qualification; nativeLinuxAcceptance remains false.
- **NOT_RUN_ENV_UNAVAILABLE**: non-Linux host or absent signed installation,
  Firejail privilege/backend or required namespace capacity. Do not replace it
  with a synthetic adapter PASS. A malformed signature/configuration or observed
  failed negative is FAIL, not unavailable.
- **CONF-LINUX-001**: separate independent native AMD64 build/runtime/migration/
  RLS/restart/restricted-UID/Kubernetes/deny-all evidence. ARM64 must be qualified
  separately; emulation never qualifies a native target.

On this development Mac the real Linux integration operation is unavailable.
Tests exercise the availability disposition without launching nested Firejail
or probing host authority from repository CI. The actual integration subset is
the external installed `--operator-preflight` followed by normal installed
verification on the named Linux host. Fixtures and source-test totals must never
be reported as those operations having run.

## Roadmap and rollback

| Phase | Packet | Current boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha 2 authority | MET-LINUX-001 | DONE: PR94 / b1d7478; no Linux proof |
| Alpha 1 corrective carryover | CTRL-FIX-003 | DONE: control PR10 / 1de7c40; 698 unit + 6 browser tests and exact-main offline replay |
| Alpha 2 foundation | MET-LINUX-002 | ONGOING: this source candidate; CI/merge/main are separate closure evidence |
| Alpha 2 qualification | CONF-LINUX-001 | WAITING: independent Linux host/build/runtime evidence |
| Alpha 1 integration | CTRL-INTEGRATE-001 | WAITING: native AMD64 gate |
| Alpha 2 runtime | MODEL-001 / EXEC-001 / RUN-001 | WAITING: native AMD64 gate and own predecessors |

Root installation, native Linux proof and full-phase completion are not outcomes
of this source packet. No model-effort transition is implied. Earlier published
meta tables are immutable historical snapshots; this packet may update only its
three allowed directories. The separately observed control-repository branch
protection gap remains a governance finding, not permission to edit settings.

Revert an unconsumed source candidate through a scoped PR. For an independently
installed candidate, the external operator restores the complete previous
signed bundle atomically with recorded permissions/digests and reruns negative
probes. Retain failure logs, signature history and retired bytes; never restore
an expired/revoked authority as if current, mutate admitted tenant data, delete
shared capacity or relax a boundary to complete a run.
