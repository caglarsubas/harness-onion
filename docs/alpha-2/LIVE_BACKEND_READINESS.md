# Trusted Linux live-backend readiness — MET-LIVE-001

Current Alpha-2 dispatch: [MET-REPAIR-014 broker handoff](BROKER_HANDOFF_READINESS.md).
Catalog 143; corrected conformance main9df7dd7 preserves 127 files / 327 tests.
MET-REPAIR-013 source gates are closed. Close this broker handoff authority before CONF-LIVE-003.
Older publication sections below retain their historical states, not current instructions.

## Decision and evidence boundary

Approved source-only roadmap amendment. The platform remains thirteen repositories,
four planes and sixteen harnesses. The catalog is now **130 packets**: 123
byte-preserved predecessors, one meta amendment and six bounded conformance
implementation packets. This does not create a seventeenth harness or a new repo.

Current source: meta PR 99 at `f0ccd9f292f332a05e8eebd17a831e19989fb739`,
contracts PR 9 at `e9de8e53cf036a90a03b1e114eba08fc0ba89ae3`,
conformance PR 5 at `88de1d9b7272a25678b01129e51d5756dbe608ed`.
Exact CI and independent local exact-main references are in the
[closed roadmap](../../architecture/live-backend-roadmap.json).
These are source checkpoints, not installed backend or native qualification.

The verified gap is source-level: the current launcher refuses execution, the
Linux handler reports `NOT_RUN_ENV_UNAVAILABLE`, request construction is data
only, and the pure verifier returns `UNIT_VERIFICATION_ONLY` with
`nativeAcceptance=false`. No missing target is inferred to exist. This macOS
ARM64 development workstation is not native Linux AMD64 capacity.

## Ordered ownership and dispatch

All six product packets target `mas-harness-conformance-labs`; each gets its own
branch/PR/coding run. No product edits occur in MET-LIVE-001.

| Phase | ID | Predecessor | Status | Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha 2 | MET-LIVE-001 | MET-REPAIR-006, CONF-LINUX-001, CON-MODEL-001 | ONGOING publication | Source-only authority |
| Alpha 2 | CONF-LIVE-001 | MET-LIVE-001, CONF-LINUX-001, CON-MODEL-001 | WAITING | Session contracts and cumulative inventory |
| Alpha 2 | CONF-LIVE-002 | CONF-LIVE-001 | WAITING | Protected Linux supervisor and isolation candidate |
| Alpha 2 | CONF-LIVE-003 | CONF-LIVE-002 | WAITING | Fixed proxy transport and zero-cost admission |
| Alpha 2 | CONF-LIVE-004 | CONF-LIVE-003 | WAITING | Native Linux build and ten fixed probes |
| Alpha 2 | CONF-LIVE-005 | CONF-LIVE-004 | WAITING | Reproducible packaging and operator handoff |
| Alpha 2 | CONF-LIVE-006 | CONF-LIVE-005 | WAITING | Trusted campaign integration and manual qualification declaration |
| Alpha 2 | CONF-LIVE-006 manual campaign | All six source closures + independent installation, capacity and signatures | WAITING | Fresh native qualification, not coding/CI |
| Alpha 1 integration / Alpha 2 | CTRL-INTEGRATE-001, MODEL-001, EXEC-001, RUN-001 | Fresh native AMD64 PASS | WAITING | Runtime product coding |
| Alpha 3 / Alpha 4 | Governed actions / enterprise platform matrix | Their existing packet DAGs | WAITING | Later independent acceptance |

The six source-enablement packets are an additive exception to the native gate,
not a waiver for runtime product work. This avoids a circular prerequisite:
the absent backend must be implementable before that backend can produce native
qualification. All existing packet YAML, Linux gate policy and source locks
remain byte-identical. The additional dispatch gate in the closed roadmap is
normative alongside, not a rewrite of, the historical predecessor lists.
After the sixth source closure the next action is **external qualification**,
not MODEL-001. No source-only completion set can open that gate.

## Internal interfaces and security invariants

These are internal conformance interfaces, not tenant-facing platform APIs.
The first packet writes the closed session schema and independent golden bytes;
the later packets consume it unchanged. Existing public envelope, capacity,
Linux record, result vocabulary and three signer purposes are unchanged.

- `validate_session(value, expected_binding, now)`: pure closed-data validation,
  returning data only. Required internal fields: schemaVersion
  `harness.planeon.ai/live-backend-session/v1alpha1`, nonce, tenantId,
  environmentId, packetDigest, commandSetDigest, releaseDigest, capacityDigest,
  endpointId, namespace, issuedAt, expiresAt and state. Digest formats and ID/time
  grammar reuse existing conformance contracts. No additional fields.
- Sessions are at most 16 KiB canonical JSON, maximum depth 8, no duplicates,
  non-finite numbers or executable/object serialization. Timestamps are UTC;
  expiry is no later than the envelope/capacity/trust validity intersection.
  Neither this object nor a `verified` flag, environment marker, path, header,
  caller-owned FD or memfd grants execution.
- `open_session(envelope_bytes, installed_context)`: protected supervisor-only
  operation, with context constructed from root-custodied installed manifest,
  public trust stores, kernel peer credentials and process/cgroup provenance.
  No public constructor accepting caller-supplied trust booleans.
- `execute_fixed(session_handle, case_id, architecture)`: only the ten fixed
  operations below. The handle is a live protected channel binding, not a
  serialized token. Request body carries only existing build_probe_request
  fields. Fixed response limit 4 MiB, request limit 16 KiB and timeout 900 seconds
  are inherited unchanged; all deadlines also cap at session expiry.
- `reserve_nonce(binding)` and terminal recording: protected durable storage,
  exclusive atomic reservation before any credential/execution, bounded journal,
  fsync and no-follow ancestry. Crash never releases a nonce for reuse.
- `verify_backend_evidence(..., expected_binding, replay_history)`: pure
  verification only. It returns the existing unit verification classification.
  Native acceptance requires independent installed custody plus actual signed
  observations, never a new boolean attached to that return value.

The historical `live.verify_linux_authority` and `linux_readiness` verifier are
hard-pinned to CONF-LINUX-001 and seven commands. They stay unchanged.
CONF-LIVE-001 owns a new pure authority adapter for the exact CONF-LIVE-006
packet digest and eight commands. CONF-LIVE-006 owns a separate pure evidence
adapter. Reuse existing crypto, canonical, capacity, shape and request
primitives; preserve every signature/role/revocation/expiry/endpoint/release/
plan/case check. No monkeypatch, constant substitution or dual-packet wildcard.
Independent negative tests must prove the old verifier still rejects the new
packet and the new verifier rejects the old seven-command envelope.

### Session transitions

| State | Allowed next state | Required evidence / effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UNAVAILABLE | none for this attempt | Missing authority/backend/target; no credentials opened |
| VALIDATED_DATA | RESERVED | Independent installed custody and kernel peer binding; data alone cannot transition |
| RESERVED | RUNNING, FAILED, CANCELLED, EXPIRED | Nonce durably consumed before execution |
| RUNNING | COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED, EXPIRED | One fixed operation at a time, bound receipts, quota reservation |
| COMPLETED / FAILED / CANCELLED / EXPIRED | none | Terminal receipt retained; descendants reaped; nonce never reusable |

Malformed/forged authority is rejected with a stable error and no operation.
Missing prerequisites yield NOT_RUN_ENV_UNAVAILABLE. An executed mandatory
assertion failure yields FAIL. Never map either condition to PASS.

### Runtime service boundaries

| Component | Owner | Dependencies | State owned | Not permitted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Protected supervisor | CONF-LIVE-002 | Installed manifest/trust, Linux primitives | Session + durable replay journal | Checkout-selected backend, ambient credentials, user flags |
| Campaign proxy client | CONF-LIVE-003 | Protected session, one signed HTTPS endpoint | Bounded request/receipt lifecycle | DNS discovery, redirects, arbitrary URL/Pod IP |
| Protected proxy server/admission | CONF-LIVE-003 | Independent capacity/RBAC/admission, fixed probes | Atomic quota reservations + operation receipts | Client-only cost approval, cluster-wide credentials in child |
| Fixed build/probe adapters | CONF-LIVE-004 | Native preexisting capacity, pinned release inputs | Run-labelled fixture results | Arbitrary argv, shell, downloads, production data mutation |
| Candidate builder | CONF-LIVE-005 | Exact allowlisted source inventory | Unsigned deterministic archive/inventory | Install, fetch, sign own acceptance |
| Campaign bridge | CONF-LIVE-006 | All of the above, pure evidence verifier | Per-case qualified evidence references | CI/native conflation or tenant acceptance signing |

The supervisor and server are external privileged trust components at runtime,
not newly deployed SaaS microservices in this amendment. The first implementation
supports CAMPAIGN_PROXY only; unsupported Kubernetes API proxy mode is explicit
unavailable. Namespace/quotas and protected server policy must already exist.
No cloud, VM, cluster or paid artifact provisioner is introduced.

Linux implementation uses reviewed fixed native syscall adapters and preinstalled
kernel facilities. Namespace/cgroup/seccomp/network enforcement must be
established before checkout or short-lived credential access. Root-custodied
server identity is separate from unprivileged campaign children. Kernel/network
probe success must be observed on native Linux; fake syscall/socket adapters in
offline tests are not a working Linux boundary. If available kernel primitives
cannot meet the contract, fail closed and report a new prerequisite; never
weaken containment to make the candidate execute.

## Packet-by-packet development instructions

Read the exact packet and all predecessor contracts/locks before edits. Each
packet pins the actual merged immediate predecessor source and retains the
original 120-test inventory. All paths below are repository-relative and exact.
No existing test is in the new path grants.

### CONF-LIVE-001 — Session contracts and cumulative inventory

Owned paths:

- `src/harness_conformance/live_session.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_backend_authority.py`
- `schemas/v1alpha1/live-backend-session.schema.json`
- `fixtures/live-backend/session-vectors.json`
- `fixtures/live-backend/baseline.json`
- `tests/live_backend/_fixtures.py`
- `tests/live_backend/_inventory.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_session.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_inventory.py`
- `docs/live-backend/session.md`

Implementation order:

1. Implement closed internal session/request/receipt validation and pure state transition functions under the exact interface and state table in the approved guide. Preserve existing public envelope/capacity/Linux evidence formats; test canonical bytes, bounded sizes, expiry, duplicate fields, wrong nonce/scope/digests and every invalid transition.
2. Seed baseline.json from the clean exact conformance source commit: 120 existing test IDs, every tracked path/hash and the original five-suite collection inventory. Pin authority and source-only model release manifest digests. All baseline data is non-executable; immutable test and helper files retain bytes.
3. Implement additive inventory tests checking AST and actual unittest discovery for all six roots and the pinned predecessor identities. Allow later production changes only at the exact new packet paths and the final live_launcher.py hook; never amend old hash guard exceptions.
4. Document that serialized session objects are not authority. API shape validate_session(value, expected_binding, now) returns validated data only; no token/env/header/verified flag unlocks execution. Protected supervisor ownership, channel peer/process binding and one-use transitions are prerequisites supplied by later packets.
5. Implement a new pure authority adapter for CONF-LIVE-006 and its exact eight-command set. Do not call or monkeypatch verify_linux_authority, which is permanently pinned to CONF-LINUX-001/seven commands. Reuse existing canonical/crypto/capacity validation primitives, independently cover every legacy signature, purpose, validity/revocation, scope, command/envelope/release/endpoint binding and capacity check, and keep the legacy verifier unchanged. Pin the new packet digest from the approved meta packet, not caller input.

Acceptance vectors: Closed-schema positives plus per-field/type/extra/missing/depth/duplicate/nonfinite/expiry mutations; transitions and all 120 predecessor identities; forged session data must not authorize any operation.

Rollback: Revert this unconsumed source increment before successors begin. After consumption use a reviewed corrective packet. Never modify installation, tenant data, trust/replay history or historical evidence.

### CONF-LIVE-002 — Protected Linux supervisor and isolation candidate

Owned paths:

- `src/harness_conformance/live_supervisor.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_linux_boundary.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_replay_store.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_supervisor.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_linux_boundary.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_replay_store.py`
- `docs/live-backend/linux-boundary.md`

Implementation order:

1. Implement the protected pre-boundary supervisor candidate with direct Linux syscall boundaries via fixed ctypes declarations: user/mount/PID/network namespaces, cgroup-v2 process custody, no_new_privs, capability drop, read-only/no-follow trust and executable custody, and enforced outbound policy. The operator must separately grant exact native prerequisites; absence yields NOT_RUN_ENV_UNAVAILABLE, never a subprocess fallback outside isolation.
2. Bind the inherited local channel to supervisor UID/custody, kernel peer credentials, child PID/start identity/cgroup, nonce, packet/source/command digest, endpoint/capacity scope and expiry. Validate before accepting requests; caller-owned FD, socket path, process flag, environment variable or memfd alone is never proof.
3. Implement root-custodied atomic reserve-before-execute replay storage using existing nonce semantics, bounded durable journal, exclusive locking, fsync and no-follow ancestry. States are RESERVED then RUNNING then terminal; expired/crashed sessions remain consumed. Kill/reap the whole child process tree at expiry/cancellation/crash, including double-fork attempts.
4. Expose injectable syscall/storage adapters for offline negative tests only. The production constructor binds fixed native implementations and has no caller-selected backend/module/command. Do not execute native isolation or change host policies during coding/CI.

Acceptance vectors: Peer/FD spoofing, parent death, PID reuse, fork escape, nonce races, crash at each journal boundary, symlink/hardlink/owner/mode tampering, expiry during I/O, IPv4/IPv6/DNS/metadata endpoint denial; fake results labelled unit-only.

Rollback: Revert this unconsumed source increment before successors begin. After consumption use a reviewed corrective packet. Never modify installation, tenant data, trust/replay history or historical evidence.

### CONF-LIVE-003 — Fixed proxy transport and zero-cost admission

Owned paths:

- `src/harness_conformance/live_proxy_client.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_proxy_server.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_mutation_admission.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_proxy_client.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_proxy_server.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_mutation_admission.py`
- `fixtures/live-backend/proxy-vectors.json`
- `docs/live-backend/proxy.md`

Implementation order:

1. Implement only the existing signed CAMPAIGN_PROXY endpoint mode for this release. Pin origin/address/TLS identity and all response sizes/deadlines to the signed endpoint; never resolve dynamic URLs, redirect, discover Pod IPs or accept proxy environment settings. Fixed stdlib transport runs only after the protected boundary, using short-lived tenant-local credential references under original custody rules.
2. Implement the bounded server-side service in the same repository but separate deployment/custody from the campaign. Independently verify capacity/signatures, namespace and nonce, pin quota/admission policy digests and resource identities, and maintain atomic reservations across concurrent requests. Client approval alone never authorizes a mutation.
3. Accept only the ten fixed operation paths from build_probe_request and validate binding through the authenticated protected session. Reject request-supplied argv, URL, GVK, namespace, artifact digest or credential scope. Server adapters use only preinstalled fixed probes and approved existing capacity; no generic Kubernetes or Docker/containerd socket exposure to the campaign.
4. Constrain mutations to run-labelled resources and exact signed manifests inside existing namespace/quota; require immutable server-enforced admission and scoped RBAC. Forbid new capacity/PVC provisioning, load balancers, autoscaling, cluster-scoped/unknown resources and cloud/billing APIs. Preserve tenant data; failed cleanup is an explicit remaining resource receipt, not permission to broaden deletion.

Acceptance vectors: Cross-tenant/namespace/nonce attempts, DNS rebind/redirect/IPv6 fallback, TLS identity, late/oversize bodies, quota races, forged capacity, revoked keys, substituted images, replayed receipts, out-of-scope cleanup and unavailable server-side policy.

Rollback: Revert this unconsumed source increment before successors begin. After consumption use a reviewed corrective packet. Never modify installation, tenant data, trust/replay history or historical evidence.

### CONF-LIVE-004 — Native Linux build and ten fixed probes

Owned paths:

- `src/harness_conformance/live_fixed_probes.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_probe_receipts.py`
- `fixtures/live-backend/probe-vectors.json`
- `tests/live_backend/test_fixed_probes.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_probe_receipts.py`
- `docs/live-backend/probes.md`

Implementation order:

1. Implement exactly the ten existing Linux case IDs per architecture; obtain identifiers and request paths from pinned CONF-LINUX-001 contracts, never invent a parallel matrix. Fixed compiled-in adapters cover native facts, Linux build/provenance, deny-all isolation, cumulative offline regression, standalone control startup, migrations, RLS, restart durability, arbitrary non-root UID/read-only filesystem and Kubernetes default deny according to the actual existing case grouping.
2. Define direct-argv recipes in reviewed code, with typed closed parameters resolved only from signed pinned release inputs. No request-selected executable/shell, arbitrary Python import, template interpolation or run-time package/image acquisition. Builder/probe tools and all images/caches must already exist on independently approved native capacity.
3. Produce bounded receipt candidates binding source/packet/commands, image/SBOM, OS/arch/libc, toolchain/cache/probe and sanitized output digests, nonce/scope, start/end and exact assertion result. Only the independently protected release/operator mechanism signs; unit keys/fixtures never produce accepted native evidence.
4. Keep AMD64 and ARM64 separate; reject translated/emulated facts, missing mandatory case, partial log, stale inputs, architecture mismatch and consumer-image substitution. Destructive migration reversal and existing tenant-data mutation are excluded; isolated run-labelled test fixtures only.

Acceptance vectors: Every ten-case result in both architectures; wrong platform, emulation, missing inputs, truncated logs, failed/skipped probes, invocation injection, source/image/cache mismatch and unsigned candidate rejection.

Rollback: Revert this unconsumed source increment before successors begin. After consumption use a reviewed corrective packet. Never modify installation, tenant data, trust/replay history or historical evidence.

### CONF-LIVE-005 — Reproducible packaging and operator handoff

Owned paths:

- `ci/build_live_backend.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_backend_package.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_package.py`
- `fixtures/live-backend/package-vectors.json`
- `docs/live-backend/operator-handoff.md`

Implementation order:

1. Implement a separate deterministic candidate builder; preserve ci/build_live_launcher.py bytes. Package only the allowlisted source/modules/public trust anchors and fixed recipes, sorted paths and fixed metadata. Reject symlinks, hardlinks, traversal, unknown extras, missing inputs, embedded credentials and mutable references.
2. Generate unsigned SOURCE_PACKAGE_ONLY inventory/SBOM-input manifests and reproducibility hashes from actual bytes. Do not invent Linux image digests or claim a Python archive is a Linux release. A --verify-reproducible mode builds twice under temporary output without host installation or downloads; tests invoke it inside declared offline acceptance.
3. Document the independent operator transaction: preexisting native host and cluster capacity, reviewed artifact/signature verification, root-owned install/custody and kernel prerequisites, fresh preflight evidence, exact versioned manifest, rollback retaining trust/replay history and no available-target fallback. Installation is manual external authority, not a product Make target or coding command.
4. Pin a complete candidate inventory covering supervisor, proxy server, fixed probes and integration hook. Final CONF-LIVE-006 rebuilds the candidate after its hook is present; publication of this source builder is not the final installed artifact.

Acceptance vectors: Byte-for-byte reproducibility, exact package closure, altered source/public key, absent integration candidate, symlink/hardlink/traversal, archive metadata, secrets scan and rollback fail-closed custody checks.

Rollback: Revert this unconsumed source increment before successors begin. After consumption use a reviewed corrective packet. Never modify installation, tenant data, trust/replay history or historical evidence.

### CONF-LIVE-006 — Trusted campaign integration and manual qualification declaration

Owned paths:

- `src/harness_conformance/live_launcher.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_backend_campaign.py`
- `src/harness_conformance/live_backend_evidence.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_campaign_integration.py`
- `tests/live_backend/test_cumulative_release.py`
- `docs/live-backend/qualification.md`

Implementation order:

1. Add the sole existing-file integration hook in live_launcher.py, after independent installed-manifest/signature/custody checks and before any checked-out code/credential access. Delegate to the fixed installed supervisor implementation, never import checkout-selected modules. Preserve the direct/unauthorized CLI refusal and pure linux_readiness.py UNIT_VERIFICATION_ONLY behavior.
2. Implement the authenticated external campaign context path in live_backend_campaign.py. Reuse the existing pure validators and data-only request builder, but obtain all transport/session authority and signed receipts from the protected channel. The offline campaign API and its three predecessor campaign outputs remain byte-identical; environment flags and fixture evidence never enter the live path.
3. Run all eight cumulative commands and inventory checks, rebuild the complete candidate via the new builder from tests, and prove every original test and all newly added packet tests are discovered. Bind all six source increments, final release inputs and current packet/command digests; never reuse a seven-command historical envelope.
4. Declare the future manual post-merge linux-baseline run through only the external root-owned launcher with an independent installed candidate, dual-signed exact eight-command envelope, capacity authorization and existing native target. This declaration does not perform or authorize an installation, network call or live run in coding/CI. Missing prerequisites remain NOT_RUN_ENV_UNAVAILABLE.
5. Publish per-architecture/per-case runtime evidence references separately from source/head/CI/merge/exact-main/package/preflight. Ten fresh mandatory AMD64 cases plus all original gate conditions are required before runtime product dispatch; ARM64 remains separate. No campaign signature becomes tenant acceptance.
6. Implement the separate pure live_backend_evidence verifier using the new authority adapter and the existing Linux evidence shape/plan/request primitives. Bind authority.packetDigest to the exact CONF-LIVE-006 packet and eight commands, not the old hardcoded digest. Preserve all three independent evidence signatures, every release/plan/case/freshness check and UNIT_VERIFICATION_ONLY/nativeAcceptance=false for pure verification. Only the protected installed supervisor plus independently verified real receipts can support a separate native qualification decision; no substitution or monkeypatch of old constants.

Acceptance vectors: Direct inner-launcher invocation, forged context, unsigned/mismatched/expired/revoked/replayed envelopes, wrong command count, credential-open ordering, source/native conflation, regression output drift, integration bypass and incomplete final-package inventory.

Rollback: Revert unconsumed integration source only. Independently installed artifacts require operator-reviewed rollback retaining replay/trust history; no tenant data or capacity destruction. Preserve completed evidence and mark mismatched native qualification stale.


## Cumulative commands and source gates

Every product packet declares the same eight commands, in this order, in one
signed deny-all-outbound process tree (prefetchCommands is empty):

```json
[
  [
    "python3",
    "-m",
    "unittest",
    "discover",
    "-s",
    "tests/meta",
    "-p",
    "test_*.py"
  ],
  [
    "python3",
    "-m",
    "unittest",
    "discover",
    "-s",
    "tests/parity",
    "-p",
    "test_*.py"
  ],
  [
    "python3",
    "-m",
    "unittest",
    "discover",
    "-s",
    "tests/alpha1",
    "-p",
    "test_*.py"
  ],
  [
    "python3",
    "-m",
    "unittest",
    "discover",
    "-s",
    "tests/fixes/runner_boundary",
    "-p",
    "test_*.py"
  ],
  [
    "python3",
    "-m",
    "unittest",
    "discover",
    "-s",
    "tests/platform/linux_baseline",
    "-p",
    "test_*.py"
  ],
  [
    "python3",
    "-m",
    "unittest",
    "discover",
    "-s",
    "tests/live_backend",
    "-p",
    "test_*.py"
  ],
  [
    "make",
    "campaign",
    "CAMPAIGN=linux-baseline"
  ],
  [
    "make",
    "evidence-verify",
    "CAMPAIGN=linux-baseline"
  ]
]
```

These are packet declarations, not commands to run individually. Use only the
installed hash-pinned offline launcher and exact wrapper contract. The generic
campaign/evidence Make targets remain the closed CONF-001 exception; no new
descriptor, Makefile or dispatcher edit is needed.

The sixth suite is flat `tests/live_backend`, explicitly collected rather than
relying on recursive namespace discovery. Its inventory compares AST modules
and actual unittest collection, rejects skips/deselection and preserves all
120 original test IDs. Preserve every original file hash except the exact
already-authorized legacy integrations and the final live_launcher.py hook.
In particular old ci/build_live_launcher.py, linux_readiness.py, live.py and
all predecessor tests remain unchanged. New packaging has a separate builder.
The new suite is cumulative: do not narrow it to the current packet tests.
Local, PR CI and separate exact-main must all cover this exact set.

## Fixed native matrix and release inputs

Exactly these ten case IDs apply independently to native amd64 and native arm64:

- `HOST_ISOLATION_NEGATIVES`
- `LINUX_TARGET_BUILD`
- `FULL_PREDECESSOR_REGRESSION`
- `CONTROL_CONTAINER_STARTUP`
- `POSTGRES_MIGRATION_AND_RLS`
- `DURABLE_RESTART`
- `ARBITRARY_NON_ROOT_UID`
- `READ_ONLY_ROOT_FILESYSTEM`
- `KUBERNETES_SMOKE`
- `DEFAULT_DENY_NETWORK`

Use the exact existing CASE_CHECKS grouping: migration and RLS share one case;
UID and read-only filesystem are distinct cases. Native target facts are
attested inputs to all cases, not a new eleventh case.

Before any manual run the independent operator must supply the actual reviewed
native host/namespace/proxy capacity, protected installation, fresh preflight,
short-lived credential custody, complete offline tools/cache, per-architecture
Linux images/SBOM and build/probe/command/source digests. Input plans cover the
existing contracts/control/conformance sources and control/postgres/kubernetes
image roles; the conformance pin covers all six backend increments. Validate
complete inventory and image/config references against the installed release,
not a mutable branch. No digest placeholders become released artifacts.

The fixed full-regression probe runs all source suites against those exact
sources, including all six conformance roots and existing contracts/control
suites. The server accepts no caller-defined test command. Failure, omission or
skip blocks that architecture. Missing build tools or native targets remains
NOT_RUN_ENV_UNAVAILABLE, without downloading or provisioning a replacement.

## Manual qualification and independent authority

Only the future CONF-LIVE-006 declaration permits a *possible* post-merge
campaign with its exact eight commands. It is not authority to perform that
run, install the candidate or contact a target. The original eleven declarations
remain unchanged; this is the twelfth.

The entry point remains only `/opt/planeon/bin/harness-live-campaign-launch`,
with only `HARNESS_LIVE_EXECUTION_ENVELOPE` as packet-declared input and the
existing fixed release/tenant trust mounts. All root manifest custody,
PLATFORM_RELEASE and TENANT_LIVE_EXECUTION signatures over the same canonical
envelope, separate CAPACITY_OPERATOR authority, endpoint policy and server-side
zero-cost admission remain required. The independently protected role owners
also sign real evidence records with their existing purposes; unit fixture
keys and the candidate itself cannot act as these owners.

An operator installation transaction is deliberately external to coding
packets. Candidate source/packaging is not installed preflight. No automatic
root install, key creation, global sudo or repeated macOS authentication flow
is introduced. Unknown native capacity is a real external prerequisite.

Record each architecture and each mandatory case separately. Native AMD64
requires all ten cases, exact current inputs, current independent signatures
and maximum age 168 hours or earlier expiry/revocation/input change. ARM64 is
separate and mandatory before advertising/releasing that target; macOS ARM64
and AMD64 emulation satisfy neither gate. Source changes affecting qualified
inputs invalidate qualification. Full Kubernetes/OCP/K3s/air-gap/upgrade/GPU
and tenant acceptance remain later independent Alpha-4 gates.

## Review and rollback

Do not amend consumed source authority to fit an implementation. If an exact
path, internal contract, kernel dependency or installed manifest revision is
missing, publish the bounded prerequisite before coding outside the grant.
Do not broaden tenant isolation, data destruction, licensing or billing
authority under a source-only approval.

Before any backend source packet has consumed this amendment, revert it as one
unit if necessary. After consumption, use reviewed successor authority, retaining
historical hashes and all failed evidence. Runtime rollback belongs to the
independent operator, preserves trust/replay history and tenant data, and
invalidates mismatched native evidence. Alpha 2 remains ongoing.

## Approved proxy contract prerequisite — MET-REPAIR-009

The [strict proxy profile](PROXY_CONTRACT_READINESS.md) closes credential and resource-rule
semantics for the new proxy without changing any accepted public wire schema,
134 existing packet YAML, product path grant, command inventory or signature role.
This one additive meta packet produces a 135-packet catalog and preserves all
176 predecessor authority files. It records SOURCE_INSPECTION_ONLY findings,
not a reproduced exploit or new product test failure.

Complete this authority before CONF-LIVE-003. Product implementation remains
in that packet's eight existing paths; preserve all 127 predecessor files and
279 test IDs. CONF-LIVE-004 owns actual probes, CONF-LIVE-005 the fixed client/server
candidate packaging, and CONF-LIVE-006 the already-bounded final hook. Mutual TLS,
independent server custody, actual policy/RBAC, durable reservations and exact-UID
cleanup must be tested independently; meta vectors are UNIT_VERIFICATION_ONLY.
Native qualification, runtime and tenant acceptance remain separate and unavailable.
No installation, key issuance, root-policy change, hosted runner or paid API is
part of this publication. Alpha 2 remains ongoing; no phase-end effort change is due.

## Approved protected policy observation — MET-REPAIR-010

Source-only prerequisite before CONF-LIVE-003: fixed local server-only observation,
independent operator custody and current enforcement evidence. Campaign API rules,
credentials, mutations and egress remain unchanged. The observer is a separately
installed open-source operator prerequisite, not an available or deployed product.
Current catalog 136; 135 predecessor YAML and strict proxy profile preserved.
Product stages 110/120/127/135/141/146/151 and eight paths/eight commands unchanged.
See the current dispatch link above for the closed schemas, native obligations,
recorded predecessor timing risk and separate acceptance gates. Alpha 2 ONGOING.

## Approved retained custody correction — MET-REPAIR-011

The [bounded handoff correction](CUSTODY_HANDOFF_REPAIR.md) adds MET-REPAIR-011 and CONF-FIX-004:
138 packets, unchanged thirteen repositories/four planes/sixteen harnesses.
The original 136 packet YAML and all prior authority records remain immutable.
CONF-FIX-004 may change only its five existing custody/supervisor/test/document
paths; old test bodies remain byte prefixes and all 279 methods remain required.
The 127-file stage and later 135/141/146/151 path counts stay unchanged.
Separate source/local/CI/merge/local exact-main closure is required before
CONF-LIVE-003 consumes the corrected checkpoint. No file-presence exemption,
path reopening, installation, new credential, dependency, native/live execution
or acceptance promotion. Prior nested-timeout failures remain unresolved history;
no timing, isolation or coverage relaxation. Alpha 2 ONGOING; effort change NOT_DUE.


## Approved bounded credential lifecycle — MET-REPAIR-012

The [credential-lifecycle correction](CREDENTIAL_LIFECYCLE_REPAIR.md) publishes
MET-REPAIR-012 and CONF-FIX-005: 141 packets, unchanged thirteen repositories,
four planes and sixteen harnesses. Preserve all 138 predecessor packet bytes.
CONF-FIX-004 closed at 0aa3ef3027f4a156d7ebed1b56af244e021d080a, 127 files / 305 tests;
its historical proof remains unchanged. CONF-FIX-005 supplies narrowly owned
late-credential/temporary-handle custody plus three cumulative source-accounting
adaptations, with every behavioral assertion and all 305 prior IDs retained.
Source stage counts and later eight-path proxy grant remain unchanged.
Publish and close each packet separately before CONF-LIVE-003. No product/native
execution, new installation, key, dependency, cloud action or bill in this meta
publication. Prior timing failures remain UNRESOLVED; no timeout or coverage
relaxation. Alpha 2 ONGOING; model-effort transition NOT_DUE.


## Approved credential-ordering correction — MET-REPAIR-013

The current dispatch link above is normative for the authentication-only client
credential exception. After independent signatures, kernel isolation, durable
reservation and retained custody checks, the client may authenticate only to its
pinned proxy. The server still requires fresh local policy observation and
transactional zero-cost admission before any probe, mutation or upstream
credential use. No TLS success or client receipt grants native acceptance.

Preserve all 141 predecessor packet bytes, historical authority and source locks.
Current catalog142; conformance checkpoint9df7dd7 has 127 files / 327 tests.
CONF-LIVE-003 retains eight paths/eight commands; no additional product repair
packet, signature role, endpoint, installed capability or billing permission.
This meta publication requires twenty-one offline commands and separate local,
required localhost CI, merge and local exact-main gates. Native AMD64/ARM64 and
Alpha3/4 remain waiting; Alpha 2 ONGOING, effort transition NOT_DUE.


## Approved broker handoff — MET-REPAIR-014

The current dispatch link is normative for the fixed server-local broker execution
handoff, including zero-resource probes. Broker-controlled execution, not an
observation, callback or token, enforces the policy generation. The proxy retains
exact resource/UID ownership and cleanup; the worker has no credentials or generic
execution API. New local custody and the fixed worker ABI do not change public
campaign/signature schemas, network endpoint sets or Kubernetes permissions.

Catalog143; all142 predecessor packet bytes and the accepted127-file/327-test
product checkpoint remain unchanged. Product packets003–006 keep their exact
paths/eight commands and source stages. This source-only publication requires22
commands, both complete replays, required localhost PR CI, merge and independent
local exact-main. No installation, new broker availability, paid service or live
acceptance is claimed. Alpha2 ONGOING; model-effort transition NOT_DUE.
